Description:
  Original idea from Roger Alsing's Weblog so that I could experiment
  with various algorithms other than a vanilla stochastic hill climber

  The idea is to take a set of random transparent triangles and adjust them
  so that the image created by the triagles approximates a given image.

Usage:
  ./main image.ppm 
  Image file must be in P6 ppm format.

  s - output the current best iteration to the working directory
  q - quit

Todo:
  Eliminate useless triangles
  Tune genetic algorithm
